# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview

Welcome to my Odin Project recipes collection! This project is part of my journey through the Odin Project curriculum, focusing primarily on HTML and CSS skills. I've created a simple web page to showcase various recipes, starting with an omelette and extending to other culinary delights.

### What I've Done

- **HTML Structure**: Developed a structured HTML document with proper semantic elements including `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>` to display content logically and clearly.
- **CSS Styling**: Applied basic CSS styling to improve the visual layout of the webpage, including text alignment, borders, background colors, and spacing.
- **Responsive Images**: Included images that are centrally aligned with the text for a more engaging user experience.
- **Navigation Links**: Integrated internal links to navigate to other recipes like cookies, dogs (probably a typo and meant something else), and fish cakes.

### Skills Developed

- **HTML and CSS Integration**: Learned how to effectively link CSS to HTML and manage styles across different elements.
- **Content Organization**: Gained experience in organizing content using HTML elements and managing layout with CSS.
- **Web Design Basics**: Started understanding design elements like color, spacing, and alignment in web contexts.

### Upcoming Improvements

- **Adding More Recipes**: Plan to expand the collection with more diverse recipes and detailed descriptions.
- **Enhancing Accessibility**: Improving the site's accessibility by adding alt texts to images and ensuring color contrast standards are met.
- **Responsive Design**: Implementing responsive design techniques to ensure the website looks good on all devices, including tablets and smartphones.
- **Code Refinement**: Refining HTML and CSS code to follow best practices and simplify maintenance.
- **Adding JavaScript**: Next lessons will add variable and operations, data types, arrays, loops, and more :)

### Learning Goals

- **Advanced CSS**: Learn more about advanced CSS features like Flexbox and Grid to enhance the layout.
- **JavaScript Integration**: Begin incorporating JavaScript to add interactive elements like recipe ratings and comments.
- **Version Control Mastery**: Improve skills in Git and GitHub for better version control and collaboration.

## Conclusion

This project is an ongoing part of my learning curve in web development, with each step taken building towards a more comprehensive understanding of building and styling web applications. I appreciate any feedback or contributions that can help me improve further!

            <ol>
                <li> <strong> Prepthe Fillings</strong> : If you’re adding any fillings, prepare them first by chopping them into small pieces. Pre-cook any meats or harder vegetables like onions to ensure they’re fully cooked in the final dish.</li>
                <li><strong>Beat the Eggs</strong> : Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and pepper. Beat the eggs with a whisk or a fork until the yolks and whites are fully blended</li>
                <li><strong>Heat the Pan</strong> : Place the skillet on the stove over medium heat and add the butter or oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Egg Mixture</strong> : Once the butter is melted and hot, pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. Tilt the pan to spread them evenly. Let the eggs cook for a few seconds until they start to set at the edges.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Fillings</strong> : Sprinkle your fillings evenly over the eggs before the eggs fully set. This allows the fillings to partially sink into the egg and stick better.</li>
                <li><strong>Fold the Omelette</strong> : As the edges of the eggs set, use your spatula to gently lift one edge and fold it over in half. If you prefer a fully cooked center, let the omelette sit for a few more seconds before folding.</li>
                <li><strong>Finish Cooking</strong> : Once folded, let the omelette cook for another minute or so until it’s fully set and golden brown on the outside. Flip it if you like both sides to be evenly cooked.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve</strong> : Carefully slide the omelette onto a plate. Serve immediately, optionally garnished with additional herbs or sides like toast or salad.</li>
